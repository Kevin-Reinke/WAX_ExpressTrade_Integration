## Beginners

Before anything, you will need to install a **web server**, a **MySQL server** and **PHP**. If you already know how to do this, skip to the [next step](#beginners).

### Local Environment

If you aren't interested in setting up an environment for local development, you can skip directly to [setting up a production environment](#production-environment) (hosting your website) right off the bat.

A web server, a MySQL server and PHP can be installed by many different means, although [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) is an all-in-one package that's incredibly easy to install and use; hence, it's a highly recommended option and you should definitely consider using it!

After installing XAMPP (or all of the above by any other mean), start **Apache** (the web server) and the **MySQL server**:

> **Caution!** Programs such as Skype can interfere with the startup of certain services, close any suspected program and try again if any service refuses to start.

> **Note**: The **web server** and the **MySQL server** must be running for you to access your *unpublished* website. If you reboot your PC, you must open XAMPP and start both again.
