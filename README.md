## Beginners

Before anything, you will need to install a **web server** and **PHP**. If you already know how to do this, skip to the [next step](#install-dependencies-3).

> **Note**: Instructions related to setting up a **MySQL server** won't be addressed in this tutorial; however, it's recommended that you go forward with the process if you plan on creating a functional website that serves user accounts, saves their settings and/or stores any other data in general.

### Local Environment

If you aren't interested in setting up an environment for local development, you can skip directly to [setting up a production environment](#production-environment-1) (where you can publish your website so anyone can visit it) right off the bat.

---

A web server and PHP can be installed by many different means, although [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) is an all-in-one package that's incredibly easy to install and use; hence, it's a highly recommended option and you should definitely consider using it!

After installing XAMPP (or the above by any other mean), start **Apache** (or the web server):

<img alt = "XAMPP - Start Apache (The Web Server)" src = "img/xampp_start_apache_server.png">

Any website you create should be placed in the `htdocs` folder where you installed XAMPP. You can access one of your websites at `http://localhost/some-website` via a web browser, where `some-website` is the path to a specific website you wish to render.

### Production Environment

Hosting your website implies that you rent a **VPS** (*Virtual Private Server*) from a company of choice to keep it accessible 24/7. There are many companies you can rent a VPS from, although some may require that you submit a whitelist application beforehand (such as [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/world)). If you're looking for a decent VPS that's also quick to set up, [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) is an excellent option!

> **Note**: You can alternatively host your website with a dedicated web hosting provider (such as [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com)), this would simplify the process a bit and can be a better option if your VPS provider doesn't provide strong protection against attacks using the default configuration. However, many dedicated web hosting providers disable certain features for security reasons - so if you want to be in complete control and/or plan on hosting more than one website while paying the same amount per month, a VPS would be the more convenient option!

#### Order/Create a VPS

Regardless of the company you decide to rent a VPS from, you must get it online with the **OS** (*Operating System*) of your choice installed. **Ubuntu** is recommended for beginners.

<img alt = "DigitalOcean - Create Droplet" src = "img/digitalocean_create_droplet.png">

Typically after creating a VPS, its log in credentials are sent via email - have them ready because you'll need them in the next step!

<img alt = "DigitalOcean - Credentials Email" src = "img/digitalocean_credentials_email.png">

> **Note**: Hosting a website on a Windows server is possible; however, it isn't recommended for beginners - many network adjustments must be applied to prevent attacks by third parties.

#### Log In & Prepare Your VPS

You will need an **SSH client** in order to log into your VPS. [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is vastly recommended!

Run PuTTY (or the SSH client of your choice) and connect to your VPS:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Connect" src = "img/putty_connect.png">

A dialog titled `PuTTY Security Alert` will prompt, hit `Yes`:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Security Alert" src = "img/putty_security_alert.png">

Enter the username and password sent to you via email:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Log In" src = "img/putty_log_in.png">

> **Note**: Passwords in the SSH client don't show whatsoever, not even as hidden characters (e.g. ••••••).

As stated in the email from DigitalOcean, you must change your password upon initially logging into your VPS for security reasons:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Change Password" src = "img/putty_change_password.png">

**(Optional)** Not all providers force you to change your password upon initially logging into your VPS, although it's recommended! You can alternatively change your password with the `passwd` command:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Change Password via CMD" src = "img/putty_change_password_via_cmd.png">

Check for and install all system updates by executing `apt update && apt upgrade`:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Update System" src = "img/putty_update_system.png">

Remove any residue files by executing `apt autoclean && apt autoremove`:

<img alt = "PuTTY - Remove Residue Files" src = "img/putty_remove_residue_files.png">

#### Create a New User

No other command in this tutorial should be executed as `root` (except the ones below). Create a new user and add it to the `sudo` group so you'll have administrative privileges:

- Create the user, replacing `example_user` with a username of your choice: `adduser example_user` (you'll be prompt to assign a password and enter information about the user)
- Add the user to the `sudo` group, replacing `example_user` with the username of the user you previously created: `adduser example_user sudo`
- Switch to the user, again by replacing `example_user`: `su example_user`

> **Note**: Log into your VPS with the credentials you previously created from now on (add **sudo** at the beginning of a command if said command requires administrative privileges); although, you can always use the **su** command to switch between users.

#### Install Dependencies

If you're using Ubuntu 18.04, use Tasksel to install a **LAMP stack** (*Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP*):

`sudo tasksel install lamp-server`

**(Optional)** Otherwise, you can install **Apache** and **PHP** separately (or if you don't want **MySQL** to be installed altogether):
- Install Apache: `sudo apt install apache2`
- Install the base PHP package and the PHP Extension and Application Repository: `sudo apt install php php-pear`
- Add the PHP module for Apache: `sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php`

Any website you create should be placed in `/var/www/html`. You can access one of your websites at `http://IP/some-website` via a web browser, where `IP` is your VPS' IP address and `some-website` is the path to a specific website you wish to render.

#### Register a Domain & Configure Name-based Virtual Hosts

Your website (or at least the `Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page`) should be accessible at this point. It's recommended that you assign a domain to your website if you plan on having visitors from all around the world; however, it isn't technically necessary - your visitors would just have trouble remembering your VPS' IP address! If you do not wish to assign a domain to your website, skip to the [next step](#install-dependencies-3).

---

There are many companies you can register a domain with. [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com) & [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) are excellent domain name providers, and both have an active support team! Either one is highly recommended.

Before you go ahead and purchase a domain, decide whether you want an **SSL certificate** or not since purchasing one after you register a domain is often more expensive (or you must pay the full price - no discount)! An SSL certificate will encrypt your visitors' information, thus improving the security of your website - it is recommended that you install one!

> **Note**: You aren't forced to pay for a domain as there are free options (such as [.tk](http://www.dot.tk)), but you are limiting the array of extensions available to you - either way, it is to note that some people tend to stay away from websites with free domains; therefore, go with a paid domain if you're aiming for success!

After registering a domain of your choice, modify its **host records**, replacing `165.227.28.23` with your VPS' IP address:

* **Type**: A Record, **Host**: @, **Value**: 165.227.28.23, **TTL**: Automatic
* **Type**: A Record, **Host**: www, **Value**: 165.227.28.23, **TTL**: Automatic

> **Note**: **@** is a shortcut for the name defined as origin ([*$ORIGIN*](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/origin.html)) - basically your domain name which also represents the root directory. The second host record will accept requests with the **www** subdomain attached.

<img alt = "NameCheap - Modify Host Records" src = "img/namecheap_modify_host_records.png">

> **Note**: When a domain is newly registered, or DNS changes are made, you can expect a propagation time up to 24 hours.

Moving forward, go back to PuTTY to configure the name-based virtual hosts so that your VPS knows what to do when someone visits your domain.
